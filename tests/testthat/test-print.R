  # The unicode character here seems to be causing all sorts of problems when it
  # comes to width settings and newlines - behaviour isn't entirely consistent
  # between interactive and noninteractive sessions (sometimes the unicode char
  # seems to be width 1, sometimes it is wider...).
  # Since it actually isn't particularly important exactly where the advice
  # message is split into separate lines, here we inelegantly sidestep that
  # problem by simply replacing all newlines (and indents) with a single space.
  # So essentially for now we are checking that the content is correct, but not
  # worrying so much about the layout. Not perfect, but good enough for now!
  # For the same reason, switch out the unicode "cross" (look for `symbol$cross`
  # in print.R) for a consistently-available ampersand
  # And switch out the unicode box-border for a good old-fashioned hyphen
